# SteamNetworkLib

A streamlined, object-oriented Steam networking library designed specifically for **MelonLoader mods**. This library dramatically simplifies Steam lobby management, data synchronization, and P2P communication compared to using Steamworks.NET directly.

## 🚀 Key Features

### **🏢 Lobby Management**
- **Create/Join lobbies** with async/await support
- **Automatic member tracking** with join/leave events
- **Steam overlay integration** for invites

### **📊 Data Synchronization**
- **Lobby Data**: Global key-value storage for all players
- **Member Data**: Per-player data visible to everyone  
- **Automatic caching** and change detection
- **Event-driven updates** when data changes

### **🌐 P2P Communication**
- **Type-safe message system** with automatic serialization
- **Broadcast or direct messaging** between players
- **Built-in message types**: Text, DataSync, DataRequest, FileTransfer
- **Custom message support** via inheritance

### **🔧 MelonLoader Optimized**
- **No complex setup** - just initialize and go
- **Automatic resource cleanup** on dispose
- **Mod compatibility checking** (like BetterJukebox track manifests)
- **Error handling** that won't crash your mod

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **.NET Framework 4.7.2+** or **.NET 6.0+**
- **Steamworks.NET** (included with game)
- **Steam**
- **MelonLoader** (for mod development)
